- The user can select only one option.
- Drop down is not keyboard accessible. Options can not be selected using the tab button on keyboard.
- The user cannot proceed to next step of registration without selecting the gender.

- There are three required fields to fill: Day, Month and Year.
- There is no specific sequence required ; all the fields are enabled independently.
- The Day field accepts values between 1 and 31 only; values outside this range are not accepted.

#### Address
- None of the individual address fields (Address , Address 2, City/Village, State/Province, Country, Postal Code) is mandatory on its own.
- However, leaving all of them blank prevents progression to the next step.
- User needs to provide value for atleast one field.
- All address fields accept alphanumeric values, numbers, and special characters.

#### Phone Number
- Phone Number field is **optional**. User can proceed with registration even if it is blank. 
- The Phone number Field does not accept alphabets and special characters as input except ("+", "-" and "()").
- Input is expected in a **standard phone number format** (e.g., +1-234-567-8901).

#### Relatives
- The **Relatives** section appears during the patient registration process.
- It contains a **dropdown menu** labeled **Relationship Type**, with the following options: Doctor, Sibling, Parent, Aunt/Uncle, Supervisor, Patient, Child, Niece/Nephew, Supervisee.
- Next to the Relationship Type, there's a **Person Name** field which allows typing the name of another person already present in the records.
- **Any registered patient can be linked as a relative**, regardless of whether the selected relationship logically applies (e.g., selecting "Supervisor" and assigning it to a random patient).
- There is no validation to confirm if the selected Person Name actually matches the role chosen in Relationship Type.
- A **plus (+) icon** is present, allowing users to **add multiple relatives**, each with its own Relationship Type and Person Name fields.

> Note: Since there is no backend validation between Relationship Type and Person Name, this may lead to **inaccurate relative associations**. However, this behavior cannot be confirmed as a bug without requirement documents.

### General Behavior â€“ Cancel Button
- After filling out all required details (Name, Gender, Birthdate), if the user clicks the **Cancel** button, they are redirected back to the **Name** section.
- The previously entered details remain intact; the form is not reset.

### Form Submission Behavior
- After clicking the **Submit** button, a message appears: **"Patient record created."**
- To verify the newly created patient record.
- Navigate to the **Find Patient Record** section.
- Type the name of the registered patient in the search bar.
- The patient's details appear in the search results, confirming successful creation.
 
 ### Note on Name Field
- Given and Family Name fields accept numbers and special characters.
- System allows submission with those values.
- No clear requirements available, so not marking it as a bug yet.

### Update on the Patient registration portal (2025-05-23)
